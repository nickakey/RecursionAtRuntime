# RecursionAtRuntime

This is a "Lecture in a Box" to help budding software engineers learn recursion. 

Recursion at Runtime is a fundamentally different way to teach recursion than most other resources. Instead of overloading the students with abstract mental models, this lecture forces the students to manually interpret basic recursive functions. 

This entire lecture will take likely take between 2-3 hours. 

I've made some videos of myself delivering the material.

You can either use these videos directly, or just have the lecturer watch them as a guide. 

Here are the corresponding videos. 

Pt. 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x6V30m4brQ

Pt. 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGFvVW7Erwk

Pt. 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt4F4T0C_eU

There are no videos after Pt.3, because after that point, the lecturer just needs to prompt the students to complete the additional recursive functions, and then walk through the correct interpretation with them.
